## **Design Choices**

### **Typography**

- The navigation bar, page titles, and buttons are all in the "'Open Sans'" font family. This design has a very become and neutral, yet friendly appearance, and even though the website is dedicated to health and fitness, it just seemed appropriate to employ.
- And for Logo I decided to apply 'Roboto' to allows letters to take up the space needed to give power aspect to logo. 


### **Colour Scheme**

The colors used in this project are:
- (#BB390F) - Rust
- (#EAE7EA )- Platinum
- (#D8B34E) - Metallic gold
  - The combination of these colors gave a very attractive look to the site. I decided go for rust for the buttons because stand out and packs an energetic punch.

-   ### Wireframes
    - The wireframes, for desktop and mobile, were created using Balsamiq and can be found bellow:

## Manual Testing

  ## Home Page

  - The user is given an introductory text and a "Shop Now" button on the homepage. The user will be directed to the products page by this.

### Creating an account

  Along with the superuser account (/admin), I've made a personal account for myself. Verify that authentication went smoothly.

  ![](static/docs/images/register.PNG)

### Logging in to an account

  There were several attempts to log in and out. It performed as intended.

  ![](static/docs/images/signin.PNG)

## Deployment

### Deployment to Heroku

This project was deployed to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/). Find the steps bellow:

1. Go to Heroku webpage and create a new app
1. Click on "Resources" tab and provision a new PostgreSQL database.
1. In order to use PostgreSQL, both packages `dj_database_url` and `psycopg2` have to be installed on Gitpod.
1. Import `dj_database_url` into the project's [`settings.py`](/eshopper/settings.py) to setup new database.
1. Disable the default database(SQLite) in the project's [`settings.py`](/eshopper/settings.py) and add the PostgreSQL database URL stored in the variable `DATABASE_URL`(can be found by clicking on the "settings" tab followed by clicking on "reveal config vars") in order to connect to PostgreSQL.
1. Run migrations (due to the use of PostreSQL) on Gitpod.

    ```
    $ python3 manage.py migrate
    ```

1. Load data (Categories and Products JSON files in the [`fixtures`](/products/fixtures) folder).
- Load categories first 

    ```
    $ python3 manage.py loaddata categories
    ```

- Then load products

    ```
    $ python3 manage.py loaddata products
    ```

1. Create superuser:

    ```
    $ python3 manage.py createsuperuser 
    ```

1. In the project's [`settings.py`](/eshopper/settings.py), re-enable the projec's default database(disabled in step number 5) and with an if statment make sure that when the app is running on Heroku the connection is made to PostgreSQL or otherwise to default database (SQLite).
1. Install `gunicorn` package on Gitpod
1. Create Procfile
1. Set `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC` to `1` on Heroku (so heroku does not collect static files during deployment).

    ```
    $ heroku config:set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1 --app e-shopperonline
    ```

1. Add `ALLOWED_HOSTS` variable(containing host name of the premiumbody app and the localhost) to project's [`settings.py`](/eshopper/settings.py) file.
1. Commit and Push to Github
1. Since the app was created via the Heroku webpage, initializing heroku git remote is necessary before pushing to Heroku

    ```
    $ heroku git:remote -a e-shopperonline
    ```

1. Push to Heroku

    ```
    $ git push heroku master
    ```

1. Finally, enable automatic deployment to Heroku when pushing to Github by going to Heroku webpage, clicking on the "Deploy" tab and then on "Connect to Github" button. Search for the eshopper repo and click on "Connect". Scroll down to the "Automatic deploys" section and click on "Enable Automatic Deploys".

### Forking the GitHub Repository

By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps:

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
1. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
1. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

### Making a Local Clone

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/artneto/Eshopper)
1. Under the repository name, click "Clone or download".
1. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link.
1. Open Git Bash
1. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
1. Type "git clone", and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.

    ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/artneto/Eshopper
    ```
    
 ### Amazon Services (S3)
 
 After the deployment to Heroku, Amazon Web Services(AWS) - S3 was used to store all the media and static files in Eshopper app.

 ## Web Marketing & Business

 A Facebook page for Eshopper was made as part of the website marketing campaign.
 Please take note that I made a fake Facebook page using the Code Institute template.
