## Deployment

### Deployment to Heroku

This project was deployed to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/). Find the steps bellow:

1. Go to Heroku webpage and create a new app
1. Click on "Resources" tab and provision a new PostgreSQL database.
1. In order to use PostgreSQL, both packages `dj_database_url` and `psycopg2` have to be installed on Gitpod.
1. Import `dj_database_url` into the project's [`settings.py`](/euser/settings.py) to setup new database.
1. Disable the default database(SQLite) in the project's [`settings.py`](/euser/settings.py) and add the PostgreSQL database URL stored in the variable `DATABASE_URL`(can be found by clicking on the "settings" tab followed by clicking on "reveal config vars") in order to connect to PostgreSQL.
1. Run migrations (due to the use of PostreSQL) on Gitpod.

    ```
    $ python3 manage.py migrate
    ```

1. Load data (Categories and Products JSON files in the [`fixtures`](/products/fixtures) folder).
- Load categories first 

    ```
    $ python3 manage.py loaddata categories
    ```

- Then load products

    ```
    $ python3 manage.py loaddata products
    ```

1. Create superuser:

    ```
    $ python3 manage.py createsuperuser 
    ```

1. In the project's [`settings.py`](/euser/settings.py), re-enable the projec's default database(disabled in step number 5) and with an if statment make sure that when the app is running on Heroku the connection is made to PostgreSQL or otherwise to default database (SQLite).
1. Install `gunicorn` package on Gitpod
1. Create Procfile
1. Set `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC` to `1` on Heroku (so heroku does not collect static files during deployment).

    ```
    $ heroku config:set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1 --app e-useronline
    ```

1. Add `ALLOWED_HOSTS` variable(containing host name of the premiumbody app and the localhost) to project's [`settings.py`](/euser/settings.py) file.
1. Commit and Push to Github
1. Since the app was created via the Heroku webpage, initializing heroku git remote is necessary before pushing to Heroku

    ```
    $ heroku git:remote -a e-useronline
    ```

1. Push to Heroku

    ```
    $ git push heroku master
    ```

1. Finally, enable automatic deployment to Heroku when pushing to Github by going to Heroku webpage, clicking on the "Deploy" tab and then on "Connect to Github" button. Search for the euser repo and click on "Connect". Scroll down to the "Automatic deploys" section and click on "Enable Automatic Deploys".

### Forking the GitHub Repository

By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps:

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
1. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
1. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

### Making a Local Clone

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/artneto/Euser)
1. Under the repository name, click "Clone or download".
1. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link.
1. Open Git Bash
1. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
1. Type "git clone", and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.

    ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/artneto/Euser
    ```
    
 ### Amazon Services (S3)
 
 After the deployment to Heroku, Amazon Web Services(AWS) - S3 was used to store all the media and static files in Euser app.

 ## Web Marketing & Business

 A Facebook page for Euser was made as part of the website marketing campaign.
 Please take note that I made a fake Facebook page using the Code Institute template.
